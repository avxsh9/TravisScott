        <li><strong>Platform Token / TicketAdda Token:</strong> a one-time-use digital token (QR or code) issued by TicketAdda to the Buyer after a successful sale via the Platform; the Platform Token is the only token accepted by TicketAdda-integrated validation flows for entry.</li>
        <li><strong>Escrow:</strong> funds from Buyer held by TicketAdda pending satisfaction of release conditions set out in these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Date/Time:</strong> scheduled start time and date of the event per the event organizer.</li>

    </section>

    <section id="eligibility" class="terms-section">
      <h2>3. Eligibility &amp; Account Registration</h2>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li>You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into a contract to use the Platform.</li>
        <li>You agree to provide accurate, complete and current information to create and maintain your Account. We may require KYC (identity verification) for certain sellers or high-value listings.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your Account.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="seller-rep" class="terms-section">
      <h2>4. Seller Representations &amp; Warranties</h2>
      <p>By listing a Ticket, a Seller represents and warrants that:</p>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li>They lawfully own the Ticket and have the right to resell or transfer it.</li>
        <li>The Ticket is genuine, valid, unexpired and has not been previously used, scanned, or invalidated.</li>
        <li>The Seller will not transfer, scan, or use the Ticket for entry after listing it on TicketAdda unless specifically authorized in writing by TicketAdda.</li>
        <li>The Seller will provide truthful and complete information about the Ticket, including seating, face value, provider proof (email, booking confirmation, etc.), and any restrictions.</li>
        <li>The Seller will comply with the event organizer's and provider's rules and any applicable law regarding resale.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Failure to comply will result in penalties as set out in these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="listing-process" class="terms-section">
      <h2>5. Listing Process &amp; Proof</h2>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li>Sellers must upload proof of ownership (provider confirmation email, purchase receipt, ticket image, or other proof) when listing a Ticket.</li>
        <li>TicketAdda may review, validate, or request additional proof before listing goes live.</li>
        <li>TicketAdda reserves the right to reject or remove listings that appear fraudulent, violate policies, or are otherwise problematic.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="purchase-escrow" class="terms-section">
      <h2>6. Purchase, Escrow &amp; Token Issuance</h2>
      <p><strong>Purchase:</strong> When a Buyer purchases a listed Ticket, the Buyer’s payment will be taken and held in Escrow by TicketAdda (or by our payment provider acting per our direction) until release conditions are met.</p>

      <p><strong>Token Issuance:</strong> TicketAdda will not forward a Seller’s raw/original provider QR/code to a Buyer. Instead, after the sale steps are complete and Seller cooperation/confirmation is satisfied, TicketAdda will issue a unique Platform Token bound to the Buyer. This Platform Token is the valid token for entry under TicketAdda’s validation flow.</p>

      <p><strong>Escrow Release Conditions:</strong> Seller funds are released from Escrow to Seller only upon one of the following conditions (whichever occurs first):</p>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li>Successful scan and validation of the Platform Token by an authorized venue scanner (the token is marked "used" by TicketAdda); or</li>
        <li>Event completion and Buyer confirmation of valid entry within the time period specified in these Terms; or</li>
        <li>Expiration of a pre-set safe-release period after the Event end if no dispute is raised by Buyer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the Buyer raises a dispute per the timeline and procedure in these Terms, funds will remain in Escrow while TicketAdda investigates.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="validation" class="terms-section">
      <h2>7. Entry Validation &amp; Scanning</h2>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li>TicketAdda tokens are intended to be one-time-use. Once a Platform Token is scanned and validated by an authorized scanner, the token is marked "used" and cannot be used again.</li>
        <li>If a Venue does not accept TicketAdda tokens or if the event organizer requires a provider-issued token only, TicketAdda will attempt to facilitate a provider transfer where supported; otherwise, TicketAdda will disclose the limitation to Buyer prior to purchase.</li>
        <li>Venue acceptance and enforcement of entry policies are controlled by the event organizer and/or venue; TicketAdda is not the venue operator and does not control venue entry policies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="disputes" class="terms-section">
      <h2>8. Buyer &amp; Seller Disputes — Reporting &amp; Evidence</h2>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li><strong>Reporting Window:</strong> A Buyer who is denied entry or who experiences an invalid/used token must report the issue through the Platform’s "Report Entry Issue" flow within <strong>6 hours</strong> of the event start time (or such other time window as TicketAdda may publish).</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence Required:</strong> Buyer should provide timestamped evidence where possible (photo, short video of scanner rejection, ticket screenshot, venue staff name/receipt). Seller should provide any evidence of transfer steps taken.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Checks:</strong> TicketAdda will run automated checks (token issuance timestamps, token usage timestamps, scanner logs, uploaded original QR hash comparisons, IP/geolocation signals) and may issue an automatic decision if high-confidence indicators of misuse exist.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Review:</strong> If automated checks are inconclusive, TicketAdda will escalate to manual review and work with the Buyer, Seller, and, where possible, venue operators to resolve the dispute.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution Remedies:</strong> If TicketAdda determines the Seller misused or fraudulently used the Ticket after sale, TicketAdda will refund Buyer from Escrow, hold Seller funds, and may impose penalties, suspend, or terminate the Seller’s account. If TicketAdda determines Buyer error or venue fault, TicketAdda will act reasonably to remediate (replacement ticket, refund or partial refund) per its policies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="refunds" class="terms-section">
      <h2>9. Refunds, Cancellations &amp; Event Changes</h2>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li><strong>Event Cancellation/Postponement:</strong> If an event is canceled or rescheduled by the event organizer, TicketAdda will follow the event organizer’s refund policy and applicable law. TicketAdda will notify affected users and process refunds or credits as applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Buyer-Initiated Cancellation:</strong> Buyers may not cancel purchases except where allowed by these Terms or by TicketAdda’s published policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Seller Cancellations / Fraud:</strong> If a Seller cancels after sale or is found to have committed fraud, TicketAdda may refund the Buyer and apply penalties to the Seller per these Terms.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="fees" class="terms-section">
      <h2>10. Fees, Taxes &amp; Payment Processing</h2>
      <p>TicketAdda charges fees (service fees, seller commission, listing fees) as displayed at checkout and on the Seller dashboard. All fees are subject to change; changes will be communicated as required.</p>
      <p>Buyers are responsible for applicable taxes, duties, and other governmental charges unless otherwise specified.</p>
      <p>Payment processing is handled via third-party payment providers. TicketAdda does not store full card details. For marketplace escrow functionality TicketAdda will use a payment partner or custodial account per applicable regulations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="penalties" class="terms-section">
      <h2>11. Seller Penalties &amp; Enforcement</h2>
      <p>If a Seller is found to have intentionally misused, resold without ownership, used a ticket after listing/sale, or otherwise engaged in fraudulent conduct, TicketAdda may:</p>
      <ul class="terms-list">
        <li>Immediately suspend or terminate the Seller’s Account;</li>
        <li>Withhold or freeze funds pending investigation or refund to Buyer;</li>
